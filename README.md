# AI-and-Machine-Learning-on-Google-Cloud

## AI Development Options available on Google Cloud

Pre-Trained APIs - Use ML Models that google already built and trained.

BigQuery ML - Use SQL Queries to create and execute ML models in BigQuery.

Auto ML - No Code Solution to build ML Models on Vertex AI

Custom Training - Code your own machine learning environment to have the control over the ML pipeline.

In terms of training data size, pre-trained APIs do not require any training data, Whereas BigQuery ML and custom training require a large amount of data.

Normally, custom training takes the longest time, because it builds the ML model from the beginning, unlike AutoML and BigQuery ML.
